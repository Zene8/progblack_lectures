* HTML tags
* What makes a good HTML page
* Web front-end frameworks

## HTML tags and elements

```
<html>
<body>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</body>
</html>
```

---

(In groups)

* Introduce yourselves
* List the HTML tags you are familiar with 
  - five minutes
* One person to create a text file with them in
  - one per line
  - just the name of the tag (no angle brackets)

---

## Putting them together

* Paste into shared doc
* We'll make a [word cloud](https://www.wordclouds.com/)

## What makes a good HTML page?

::: incremental

* Standards compliant HTML5 [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/) 
  - Check with <https://validator.w3.org/>
  - Or developer tools or chrome plugin
* Accessible: alt tags; contrast; [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/); [MDN advice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility)
* Mobile-friendly: viewport; lightweight; responsive
* Quick-loading
* Review with e.g. [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

## HTML/CSS Frameworks

::: incremental

- Apply styles with CSS classes
- Pre-written HTML templates and (some) JavaScript
- Make it easy to make things look nice
- Make it easy to make things responsive
- Can sometimes be heavy (large file size, slow)
- e.g. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [alternatives](https://www.creative-tim.com/blog/educational-tech/bootstrap-alternatives/) including [CSS](https://colorlib.com/wp/free-css3-frameworks/)
- N.B. Frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) are different things: they generate HTML

## Example

To sieve out the stuff we don't want we can

- make our page HTML5 compliant
- include it in a bootstrap template
